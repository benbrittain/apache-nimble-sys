# apache-nimble-sys
Rust FFI bindings for the Apache Nimble project

# How to use
You must define the Nimble porting layer external to this -sys package.

Concrete types used in the compilation of this library are generated by
`cbindgen` and need to be included by pointing an environment variable
`NIMBLE_PORT` at a directory which exposes them.
